## Fancy Indexing Masking

import numpy as np 

m1= np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
print(m1)


print()
## Below code will return matrix with boolean values in matrix format 
print(m1<6)



## while checking the below the code will return in 1D matrix 
## Below masking would return value where its able to get a remainder of 0
print(m1[m1%2==0])
